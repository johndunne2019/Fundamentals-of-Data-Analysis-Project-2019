# Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Project-2019

This repository contains my project 2019 for the module Fundamentals of Data Analysis at GMIT. See here for the instructions: https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/project-2019-fundda/raw/master/project.pdf. References and resources I used in compiling this project are listed in the references section at the foot of this Readme file.

## About this Project
This project concerns the well known tips dataset and the Python packages Seaborn and jupyter. In completing this project I will download the tips dataset and use the Python packages Seaborn and jupyter to perform some analysis on the dataset in order to explain the dataset in detail. I will also endeavour to analyse whether there is a relationship between the total bill and tip amount.  

## How to download this repository
1. Go to GitHub.
2. Go to my repository: https://github.com/johndunne2019/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Project-2019
3. Click the clone/download button.
4. Save the repository to a local folder location on your machine.
5. You will need to navigate to this folder location on the command line in order to run the program.
6. Details on how to run each individual script in this repository is included later in this Readme file.

## jupyter lab
In completing this project I have set up this repository and created a jupyter lab notebook in which I will write some code to analyse the tips dataset. I viewed the lecture videos on jupyter notebooks and also completed additional reading in order to familiarise myself with jupyter. Both jupyter notebook and jupyter lab were discussed in lecture videos and I also did some additional reading about the differences between both https://ipython-books.github.io/36-introducing-jupyterlab/ and https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-is-ready-for-users-5a6f039b8906. Following this research I decided to use jupyter lab for my project.
